# Guessing_Game

Task Submission for the Prodigy Infotech Internship! 

I developed a Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ² in Python, where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The game provides real-time feedback if the guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts. Once the player guesses correctly, the game congratulates them and displays the total attempts taken.

This project helped me enhance my Python programming skills and strengthen my logic-building abilities.
